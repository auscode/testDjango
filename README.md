# testdjango Repository

This repository contains a basic Django setup for applying CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in an API. It uses Django and Django Rest Framework to create a simple API for managing movies. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Requests

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auscode/testdjango.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd testdjango
```

3. Migrate the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create a superuser account.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The development server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## API Endpoints

This project provides the following API endpoints for managing movies:

- `GET /movies/`: Retrieve a list of all movies.
- `POST /movies/`: Create a new movie.
- `GET /movies/{id}/`: Retrieve details of a specific movie.
- `PUT /movies/{id}/`: Update details of a specific movie.
- `DELETE /movies/{id}/`: Delete a specific movie.

## Usage

You can use tools like `curl`, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or write your own client to interact with the API. Here is an example of creating a new movie using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "name": "URI",
    "description": "A war-ridden movie"
}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/
```

Feel free to modify and expand upon this basic setup to meet your specific requirements for CRUD operations in your Django API.
